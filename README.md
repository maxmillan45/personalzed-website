# Personalized Webpage Project

## Description
This project is an interactive webpage that:
- Stores user name and age in localStorage
- Displays a personalized greeting
- Calculates age in months
- Shows age-based content
- Displays motivational quotes using a loop

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- localStorage
- Git

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open index.html in your browser

## Deployment
Hosted using GitHub Pages


## How It Works

The user enters their name into the input field.

JavaScript captures the input using:

document.getElementById()

An event listener listens for a button click:

addEventListener("click", function(){})

The DOM updates dynamically to display a personalized greeting.

Example output:

* Variables (let, const)

* Functions

* Event Listeners

* Conditional Statements (if/else)

* DOM Manipulation

* Input Validation
